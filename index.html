            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am Urvik Jada. I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from ITNU, Ahmedabad, Gujarat. During my academic journey, I developed a strong foundation in various aspects of computer science and engineering, which has fueled my passion for technology and innovation.<br><br>

                I have prior experience as a Full Stack Developer, where I gained hands-on experience in developing and managing both front-end and back-end components of web applications. This role allowed me to work with various programming languages and frameworks, enhancing my problem-solving skills and understanding of the software development lifecycle. <br><br>
                
                I am eager to learn about Data Structures and Algorithms, as I believe these are crucial for solving complex problems efficiently and writing optimized code. I am enthusiastic about expanding my knowledge in this area to further my career in software development. <br><br>
                
                Learning Data Structures and Algorithms will not only help me improve my coding skills but also prepare me for competitive programming and technical interviews. I am committed to continuous learning and professional development, and I am excited to take on new challenges and opportunities in the field of computer science.</p>
